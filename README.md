# Data-url-s
a bunch of url's for different games including GN math, UGS files, and HTML games

all you have to do to run the game is to copy the url and paste it in the search bar
all of them are made from base 64 making them hard if not impossible to blocked by schools


to make your own you will have to get a singlefile html and put it into one of the links

https://www.base64decode.org/

https://base64.guru/converter/encode/html

https://www.base64encode.net/

https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base64_encode.html

https://jam.dev/utilities/base-64-encoder

they should mostly all work, if not try the converter in the files
